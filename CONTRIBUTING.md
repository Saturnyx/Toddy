## üí° How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome several types of contributions:

- üêõ **Bug Reports**: Help us identify and fix issues
- ‚ú® **Feature Requests**: Suggest new functionality
- üîß **Bug Fixes**: Submit fixes for existing issues
- üé® **New Features**: Add new commands or capabilities
- üìö **Documentation**: Improve README, comments, or guides
- üß™ **Tests**: Add or improve test coverage
- üéØ **Performance**: Optimize existing code

### Good First Issues

Look for issues labeled:
- `good first issue` - Perfect for newcomers
- `help wanted` - We'd love community help on these
- `documentation` - Great for non-code contributions

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Environment Configuration

1. **Create a test Discord server** where you can safely test the bot
2. **Set up a development bot** separate from any production instance
3. **Configure your `.env` file**:
   ```env
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_development_bot_token_here
   ```

### Testing Your Changes

1. **Run the bot locally**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Test all affected commands** in your test server
3. **Verify edge cases** and error handling
4. **Check that existing functionality** still works

## üìù Code Guidelines

### Python Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and concise

### Code Quality

```python
# Good example
@bot.command("todo:")
async def todo(ctx, *, message: str):
    """Adds a task to the to-do list with optional tags.
    
    Args:
        ctx: The command context
        message: The task message with optional tags
    """
    # Implementation here
```

### Comments and Documentation

- Add clear comments for complex logic
- Update docstrings when modifying functions
- Include usage examples in command docstrings
- Document any new configuration options

### Error Handling

- Always handle potential errors gracefully
- Provide helpful error messages to users
- Log errors appropriately for debugging

```python
# Good error handling example
try:
    # Bot operation
    await ctx.send("Task added successfully!")
except discord.Forbidden:
    await ctx.send("I don't have permission to perform this action.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"[ERROR] Unexpected error: {e}")
    await ctx.send("An unexpected error occurred. Please try again.")
```

## üì§ Submitting Changes

   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the code guidelines

3. **Test thoroughly** in your development environment

4. **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive messages:
